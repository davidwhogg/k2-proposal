\subsection*{Budget justification}

\paragraph{Senior personnel:}
Funds are allocated for 0.5 month per year of the PI's salary.
The PI will be responsible for scientific oversight of the project,
supervising the completion of scientific papers and delivery of
\catalogname\ to the community.

\paragraph{Personnel:}
Funds are requested for a full-time postdoctoral scholar, who will
execute the scientific program.
This includes running, modifying, and publishing the software used;
creating, vetting, and delivering \catalogname;
and performing and publishing the population inferences.

\paragraph{Equipment:}
Funds are requested for a modest laptop computer (11-inch MacBook Air
or equivalent) for the PI and the postdoctoral scholar in Year~1 only.

\paragraph{Travel:}
Because this project involves joint supervision of the postdoctoral
scholar by the PI and the unfunded Co-I, who will be resident in
Seattle, we have requested substantial travel funding.
The travel funding is estimated on two trips per year for the
postdoctoral scholar and the PI to Seattle, three trips per year
for the Co-I to New York, and one trip per year for all three of
the personnel to the American Astronomical
Society Winter Meeting to disseminate and advertise results.

\paragraph{Publications:}
Funds are allocated for about 20 pages of ApJ or AJ page charges per
year, plus contingency for poster-making or other publication-related
supplies.

\paragraph{Code preservation services:}
We did not allocate any funding to long-term code storage and
preservation.
We have good experience both with NYU ITS and the company
\project{github} for long-term storage and maintenance of code,
including revision histories.
