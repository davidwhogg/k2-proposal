In a breakthrough for exoplanet research and open science, the new
\kepler\ \ketu\ Mission is delivering telemetered time-domain imaging
data on tens of thousands of stars in each of a dozen survey fields to
the public (essentially) as soon as the data have been telemetered
down by the Spacecraft.
Here we propose to build on this openness by \textbf{creating
  \catalogname}, an exoplanet catalog built from (or updated by)
every \ketu\ Campaign data set as soon as possible after each Campaign
data release.
Importantly, we will also \textbf{release the catalog and every
  update} to the community immediately upon creation, as we did with
a pilot catalog made from \ketu\ Campaign~1 data.
We will also use \catalogname\ and our expertise in hierarchical
probabilistic modeling to produce a noise-marginalized,
completeness-corrected (and geometry-corrected) inference of the true
distribution of exoplanets, given the \ketu\ and \kepler\ Main Mission
data.

In it's basic form, \catalogname\ will be built by... simultaneous
fitting... cleverness... hand vetting... completeness
evaluation... false-positive modeling.

Over the course of the project, the authors propose to pursue a set of
enhancements and improvements to the catalog-generation methods and
software... basis vectors... Gaussian Processes... machine
vetting... extended noise models...
All of these improvements will be propagated into annual
re-processings and re-releases of all the \ketu\ Campaigns released to
date.

The authors will produce a full, completeness-corrected and
noise-marginalized inference of the true exoplanet population, using
\catalogname\ as the fundamental data.
This inference will proceed by hierarchical probabilistic methods,
following prior work by the authors...

All software used in this project will be made public under an
open-source license and maintained in public github repositories in
contract with a reliable vendor.
